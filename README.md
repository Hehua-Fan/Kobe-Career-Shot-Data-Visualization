# Kobe-Career-Shot-Data-Visualization

## Importance
In this project, I initially created numerous visualizations from the dataset but narrowed it down to the most impactful eight figures to present.  Each visualization was chosen to highlight a unique perspective on Kobe Bryant's legendary career while ensuring the data conveyed consistent and interconnected insights.  By visualizing the data in diverse formats, such as scatter plots, bar charts, and accuracy heatmaps, we capture the physical locations of shots, their frequencies, and efficiency.  Scatter plots like the charts (Figures 2, 3 and 4) vividly represent scoring patterns but may lack detailed trends.  Meanwhile, accuracy plots like Figures 5 and 6 focus on statistical performance but cannot provide spatial context.  Together, these visualizations complement each other, offering a holistic understanding of Kobeâ€™s performance across his career.

## Data and Method
The dataset used for this analysis is the open-source Kaggle dataset, "Kobe Bryant Shot Selection," which contains 30,699 shots spanning 20 seasons of his career.  All visualizations were created in Python using libraries such as Pandas for data preprocessing, Matplotlib and Seaborn for chart creation, and other Python packages for additional support.  Different visualizations required tailored preprocessing steps, such as filtering by time and shot type for bar charts or aggregating accuracy by zone for heatmaps.  Additional details on the code, dataset, and methodology are available in the GitHub repository linked below.
